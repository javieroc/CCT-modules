### Task 3

**Risks**

1. Phishing Attacks
   - Likelihood: High – Phishing scams are prevalent, making schools a common target for such attacks.
   - Impact: Moderate to High – If successful, phishing can compromise sensitive credentials of staff and students, leading to security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns.

2. Social Engineering
   - Likelihood: High – Tactics such as impersonation and phone scams are straightforward to execute and often effective within educational environments.
   - Impact: Moderate – Staff may unintentionally disclose sensitive information, which could result in unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

3. Unauthorized Access
   - Likelihood: Moderate – This can occur due to weak passwords, insufficient access controls, or lapses in physical security measures.
   - Impact: High – Unauthorized access poses a significant risk to student records and financial information, potentially eroding trust and resulting in legal ramifications.

4. Malware (Viruses, Ransomware)
   - Likelihood: Moderate – Malware can infiltrate systems through malicious attachments or compromised websites, although schools may be less targeted by ransomware compared to larger organizations.
   - Impact: High – Malware infections, particularly ransomware, can cripple critical systems, disrupt school operations, and lead to expensive recovery processes.

5. Data Breaches
   - Likelihood: Low to Moderate – Data breaches may result from phishing, unauthorized access, or malware attacks.
