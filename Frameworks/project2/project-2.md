## The Evolution of Cybersecurity Governance Models: Impact of GDPR and NIS2 on Multinational Organisations Operating in Ireland

### Introduction

In today’s digital world, the importance of cybersecurity governance has grown significantly as organisations face increasing risks from cyber threats and strict regulatory environments. Cybersecurity governance refers to the frameworks and strategies that organisations use to manage their digital security risks, comply with legal requirements, and protect sensitive information. For multinational organisations operating in Ireland, two major regulatory frameworks, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network and Information Security Directive 2 (NIS2), have profoundly influenced how they approach cybersecurity.

GDPR, introduced in 2018, focuses on safeguarding personal data and providing individuals with greater control over their information. Its impact has extended far beyond the European Union, influencing data protection laws globally. NIS2, adopted in 2022, builds on its predecessor to strengthen cybersecurity across critical sectors, including healthcare, energy, and finance, by introducing stricter requirements for organisations to secure their networks and report incidents promptly.

This report explores the evolution of cybersecurity governance models and examines how GDPR and NIS2 have reshaped business practices in Ireland. It begins with an overview of key components of cybersecurity governance, followed by an analysis of GDPR and NIS2’s impact on organisations. The challenges businesses face and the strategies they employ to adapt to these regulations are also discussed. Finally, the report looks to the future, considering how governance models might evolve to address emerging threats and regulatory changes. By understanding these developments, organisations can strengthen their security measures, improve compliance, and remain resilient in a rapidly changing digital landscape.


### Cybersecurity Governance Models and Key Components

Cybersecurity governance refers to the system by which organisations manage cyber risks and ensure their operations align with regulatory requirements. Governance models provide the framework for establishing accountability, developing policies, and implementing robust security measures.

**Key Components of Cybersecurity Governance**

One of the foundational aspects of cybersecurity governance is the development of clear policies and procedures. These documents outline how sensitive data should be handled, how access to systems is granted, and how incidents should be managed. Policies provide overarching guidelines, while procedures break them down into actionable steps.

Standards and frameworks are another essential aspect of governance. Popular frameworks such as ISO 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and COBIT help organisations establish a structured approach to managing information security. These frameworks guide organisations in identifying risks, implementing controls, and continuously improving their security posture.

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are vital to effective governance. Leadership teams, including Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and Data Protection Officers (DPOs), oversee strategy and compliance. Employees also play a role by adhering to security policies and participating in training.

Continuous monitoring is another key component. Organisations use advanced tools to detect vulnerabilities and monitor for cyber threats. Regular reporting ensures that management stays informed about the security landscape and can make timely decisions.

Finally, training and awareness programs are indispensable. Employees must understand the importance of cybersecurity and how their actions can impact the organisation. This not only reduces risks but also fosters a culture of security awareness.


### The Impact of GDPR on Organisations in Ireland

**Understanding GDPR**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in 2018, is a landmark piece of legislation aimed at protecting the personal data of EU citizens. It applies to organisations operating in the EU or handling the data of EU residents, requiring them to implement strict data protection measures.

GDPR grants individuals enhanced rights over their data, such as the ability to access, update, or delete it. Organisations must also be transparent about how they process data, maintain detailed records, and report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours of discovery. Non-compliance with GDPR can result in significant fines, up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover.

**Organisational Impacts**

GDPR has had a profound impact on how organisations operate. One major effect has been the increase in compliance costs. Businesses have had to invest in data protection technologies, staff training, and legal consultations. For many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, these expenses represent a considerable burden.

Business practices have also undergone substantial revisions. Organisations are now required to adopt data protection by design, ensuring that privacy considerations are embedded in their systems and processes from the outset. This has necessitated the redesign of workflows, IT infrastructure, and customer-facing systems.

Operational challenges are another consequence of GDPR. Companies must respond to data access requests, report breaches promptly, and demonstrate accountability to regulators. These requirements have placed additional pressure on internal teams, highlighting the need for well-defined processes and adequate resources.

While GDPR compliance has been challenging, it has also led to positive outcomes. Organisations that prioritise data protection have gained greater trust from customers and partners, enhancing their reputations in competitive markets.


### The Impact of NIS2 Directive on Organisations in Ireland

**Overview of NIS2**

The NIS2 Directive, adopted in 2022, represents the EU’s effort to bolster cybersecurity across member states. Building on its predecessor, NIS2 expands its scope to include additional sectors such as cloud services, public administrations, and supply chain providers. The directive sets stricter requirements for incident reporting, security measures, and leadership accountability.

Under NIS2, organisations must report significant cybersecurity incidents within 24 hours and provide detailed follow-up reports. Leadership teams, including boards of directors, are now explicitly responsible for ensuring compliance, making governance a top-level priority.

**Implications for Businesses**

The broader scope of NIS2 means that many organisations previously unaffected by cybersecurity regulations now fall under its jurisdiction. These businesses must implement stronger security measures, conduct risk assessments, and secure their supply chains.

Compliance with NIS2 also entails higher costs. Organisations must invest in technologies such as intrusion detection systems and endpoint security tools. Additionally, they need to recruit skilled cybersecurity professionals, a task complicated by talent shortages in the field.

Another challenge lies in managing supply chain risks. Organisations are required to ensure that their vendors and partners meet the same security standards, increasing the complexity of compliance efforts. Non-compliance, meanwhile, can lead to substantial penalties and reputational damage.

Despite these challenges, NIS2 has driven organisations to adopt more robust cybersecurity practices, ultimately improving their resilience against cyber threats.


### Adapting to GDPR and NIS2: Organisational Strategies

Faced with the demands of GDPR and NIS2, organisations have taken various steps to align their operations with regulatory requirements. One key adaptation has been the recruitment of dedicated professionals, such as Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and cybersecurity specialists, to oversee compliance efforts. These experts help organisations navigate the complex landscape of regulations and implement effective security measures.

Technology investments have also been critical. Many organisations have adopted advanced tools for encryption, intrusion detection, and threat monitoring. These technologies not only enhance security but also support compliance by providing visibility into potential risks.

Incident response planning has become a central focus. Organisations have developed comprehensive plans to address cybersecurity incidents, ensuring that breaches are detected, contained, and reported in a timely manner. Regular testing of these plans helps to identify gaps and improve preparedness.

Staff training has played a vital role in fostering a culture of security awareness. Employees are educated about best practices, such as recognising phishing attempts and safeguarding sensitive information. This reduces the likelihood of human error, which remains a common cause of data breaches.

Despite these efforts, challenges persist. Smaller businesses often struggle to balance compliance costs with operational needs. The overlapping requirements of GDPR, NIS2, and other frameworks can also create confusion, necessitating careful coordination.


### Future Directions in Cybersecurity Governance

As cyber threats continue to evolve, organisations must remain agile in their approach to governance. Emerging risks, such as ransomware and AI-powered attacks, require constant vigilance and innovation.

One area of concern is the potential impact of quantum computing. While still in its early stages, quantum technology could render current encryption methods obsolete, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.

Regulations are also likely to evolve. Updates to GDPR may address new challenges, such as the use of artificial intelligence and biometric data. Similarly, the scope of NIS2 could expand to include additional sectors and introduce stricter requirements for smaller businesses.

To stay ahead, organisations should adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity governance. This includes implementing zero-trust architectures, which limit user access and continuously verify identities. Collaboration with regulators, industry peers, and supply chain partners is also essential to address shared risks.

Investing in employee skills is another priority. Upskilling staff ensures that organisations have the expertise needed to navigate complex threats and regulations. Advanced technologies, such as AI-driven security tools, can further enhance threat detection and response capabilities.


### Conclusion

Cybersecurity governance has become a critical priority for organisations in an era where digital threats are increasing, and regulations are becoming stricter. Multinational businesses operating in Ireland, in particular, have had to significantly adjust their practices to comply with the requirements of GDPR and NIS2. These regulations have not only introduced stringent obligations for data protection and incident reporting but have also fostered a culture of accountability and transparency.

The adoption of GDPR has driven organisations to implement stronger data protection policies, enhance transparency with customers, and embed privacy considerations into their business operations. On the other hand, NIS2 has expanded the scope of cybersecurity requirements, compelling organisations to strengthen their incident response capabilities, secure their supply chains, and ensure top-level management takes an active role in compliance efforts.

While the journey to compliance has brought challenges, including high costs, resource constraints, and operational complexity, it has also led to positive outcomes. Businesses that embrace these regulations benefit from stronger resilience against cyberattacks, increased trust from stakeholders, and competitive advantages in markets where data protection and cybersecurity are key concerns.

Looking to the future, cybersecurity governance will need to evolve to address rapidly emerging threats, such as AI-driven attacks and the potential risks posed by quantum computing. Regulations like GDPR and NIS2 may also undergo updates to stay relevant to new technologies, including artificial intelligence and biometric data. Organisations must prepare by adopting proactive governance strategies, investing in cutting-edge security technologies, and fostering continuous collaboration with regulators and industry peers.

Ultimately, by prioritising cybersecurity governance and maintaining a forward-thinking approach, organisations can not only meet compliance requirements but also enhance their overall resilience. This enables them to safeguard their operations, protect customer data, and thrive in an increasingly interconnected and regulated digital world.
